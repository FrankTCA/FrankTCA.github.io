    <p>My strenths are thinking, as I can think about a lot of things that can help myself or the rest of the world. I also have the strenth of having a lot of energy. People wish they had the same amount of energy that I do. Another strength that I have would be smartness. I am very smart, with an IQ of a whopping 146 genius. Those would be my main strengths.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b2" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      </p><p>My topics are very interesting. My main topic is computer programming. I am very interested in computer programming and want to do it professionally when I grow up. Another ropic of mine is theoretical physics. There is something enjoyable about making equations that I really enjoy and like to do as a hobby. I also enjoy phycological tricks to do on people's brains. I love trees. I don't really care about any other type of plant, but I love trees. I can identify all types of trees, and can describe their behaviors. I also enjoy lame practical jokes. Hey, your shoes are untied!</p>
    <p></p>
  </div>
  <div id="b3" style="display: none;">
    <p>My optimal conditions are different from most other's. I have fun when I am with freinds, and am perfectly happy when I am alone, but I still think that being invited to do things is fun. I am not much of an outsider, and do not wish to spend much more time than I have to outside. The time I like to be outside, however, is in a forest with trees. Trees are one of my favorite things. If I was ever in a survival situation, I would be in a forest, because I know everything about all of the trees and can identify which ones to use for resources, shelter, etc. I have very interesting optimal conditions.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b4" style="display: none;">
    <p>I have never really had a proper relationship. I have like a few girls before, but they didn't really like me back. I do like a girl now, but I don't know if she likes me back. I will not disclose the names of anybody in this presentation.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b5" style="display: none;">
    <p>My yes moments are awesome to have, and happen quite often. My main yes moment is when I finally finish a computer program that I have been working on for a while. I feel very satisfied and I finally get to distribute the program to the general public. Another yes moment is when the week of school is finally over and I have two days of the weekend coming up where I can program even more. I also get a very big yes moment when I click the 'upload' button on YouTube. I don't know why, but there is a satisfying phycological effect of uploading a video that makes me happy. I have many yes moments in my life.</p>
